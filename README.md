# App-SRE Container Images

This repository contains container images for App-SRE projects. It serves as a place for images that are not associated with a specific project or for base images used by App-SRE projects.

Each directory in this repository contains the necessary information to build a separate image. 
When changes are pushed to the `master` branch, the [`build_images.sh`](build_deploy.sh) script is triggered.
